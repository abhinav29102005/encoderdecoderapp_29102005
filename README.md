Features of the Encoder/Decoder App

Message Encoding:

Users can encode any message using a Caesar Cipher algorithm.
Allows input of a custom shift value to determine how the characters are transformed.
Displays the encoded result immediately.

Message Decoding:

Users can decode an encoded message by inputting it along with the correct shift value.
Automatically reverses the encoding process to reveal the original text.
Flexible Input Options:

Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Leaves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, symbols) unchanged for a cleaner experience.

Real-Time Results:

Encoded and decoded results are shown dynamically upon clicking the respective buttons.

User-Friendly Interface:

Simple and intuitive layout with distinct sections for encoding and decoding.
Clear labels, outlined text fields, and responsive buttons make the app easy to navigate.

Shift Value Validation:

Accepts only numeric input for the shift value.
Handles invalid or empty shift inputs gracefully by defaulting to zero.

Scrollable Layout:

The app supports vertical scrolling, ensuring compatibility with devices of varying screen sizes.

Attractive UI Design:

Uses vibrant colors like blue for results and headings to enhance visual appeal.
Proper spacing and alignment for a clean, professional look.

Reusable Logic:

Implements a reusable Caesar Cipher logic for both encoding and decoding.
Handles edge cases like negative shifts and large shift values efficiently.

Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Built using Jetpack Compose, ensuring smooth performance on Android devices.


Description of the Encoder/Decoder App

The Encoder/Decoder App is a simple and efficient tool for encoding and decoding text messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Designed for both casual and educational purposes, the app enables users to experiment with cryptographic techniques by applying shift-based transformations to their messages.

The app features a clean and user-friendly interface with two dedicated sectionsâ€”one for encoding messages and another for decoding them. Users can input a message, specify a shift value, and instantly see the transformed result. Whether you're a student learning about cryptography or someone looking for a fun way to send encoded messages, this app offers a perfect solution.

By supporting uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters, the app ensures flexibility and practicality. Its vibrant UI design, error handling, and real-time functionality make it a reliable and enjoyable tool for encoding and decoding text.
